I have created a Space Shooter using Unity DOTS. 
I have followed along the lectures and then also created Asteroid Authoring and Asteroid Move System,
which is used to make the Asteroids move down towards the player.
Like the Projectiles the Asteroids also despawn after a certain time to save memory.
